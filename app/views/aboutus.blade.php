                            FieldMax® is the flagship solution from Experion Technologies. Experion Technologies is one among the top 100 fastest growing companies in Asia.  In a short span, Experion has delivered software products and custom applications to 200+ customers in 26 countries across Europe, North America, Africa, Asia, Australia and Middle East.<br><br>
                            In 2009 Experion spent several months working with a select group of customers to help us design and develop FieldMax® from ground up. We spent time with retailers, distributors, salespeople, sales managers, middle management and executive management.Our goal was to uncover the key challenges faced by consumer goods manufacturers and distributors when dealing with field sales, distribution and their retail execution strategies.<br><br>
                            We also set up an advisory panel of Subject Matter Experts, consultants, architects, CEOs, FMCG distributors and National Sales Managers. We launched the first version in 2010. We then continued to benchmark FieldMax® with prioritized customers needs and went on to implement FieldMax® for  several small and mid sized Consumer Products/ FMCG manufacturers.By early 2011, it was evident that our solution had found its place of acceptance. Through word of mouth and references, we acquired over 20 customers in first 12 months. By 2012, over 50 companies, spread across three countries, experienced the benefits of FieldMax®. Our customer base ranges from small distributors to the world's second largest food and beverages manufacturer.<br><br>
                            Today, thanks to our customers and consulting panel, we are convinced we have built one of the best mobile based sales force automation and distribution management solution.We look forward to understanding how exactly we can help you with your sales and distrubution operations.We can be reached at  sales@experionglobal.com.<br><br>
