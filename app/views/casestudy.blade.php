                                The market approach was to reach to the end customer through a series of networks involving C&F agents, super stockiest, distributors. Although these networks made the product movement easy the company had limited visibility and insufficient data on secondary sales. Majority of the distributors are not IT savvy. Deploying a company provided distributor billing system not acceptable to distributors.
                                Company has to depend on monthly reports sent in by the distributors to know the secondary sales made by them. <br><br>
                                Delay in receiving information from the distributors makes it difficult to gauge the effectiveness marketing initiatives on time. The company pays salaries of the distributor sales team, yet the effectiveness of the team is not visible to the company. Company at no time could have data about the stock held by retailers, and the correspondingly had zero visibility to tertiary sales (ie sales made by the retailer to the end customer).
