                                The market approach was to reach to the end customer through a series of networks involving Carry forward (C&F) agents, super stockiest, distributors. Although these networks made the product movement easy the company had limited visibility and insufficient data on secondary sales. The majority of the distributors are not IT savvy. Deploying a company provided distributor billing system not acceptable to distributors. <br><br>
                                The company has to depend on monthly reports sent in by the distributors to know the secondary sales figures achieved. <br><br>
                                Delay in receiving information from the distributors makes it difficult to gauge the effectiveness of marketing initiatives on time. The company pays salaries of the distributor sales team, yet the effectiveness of the team is not visible to the company. The Client had no access to data about stock held by retailers. They also had  zero visibility into tertiary sales (sales made by the retailer to the end customer).
