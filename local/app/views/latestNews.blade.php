                                <p>Companies often invest heavily in providing hardware assets like refrigerators to the retail stores as part of their retail execution plan. This is in addition to other investments made in the retail shelf space.
                                    <br>
                                    <br> Executing audits to track the effective execution of merchandising plans involves large investment in merchandiser manpower. Tracking the utilisation and productivity of the hardware assets as part of the merchandising audit is an additional challenge. Merchandiser and Asset Auditors often struggle in getting or sharing the audit data owing to the manual flow of information through documents and e-mails.
                                    <br>
