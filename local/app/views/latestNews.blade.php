                                <p>Companies spend lot of effort and resources for in-store promotions. The objective of these promotions are to generate more demand for their products, especially at a time when competition is at its heights and the line of differentiation is marginal. Keeping track of the spend and ensuring that the promotional campaigns are executed properly is a challenge for everyday. While it is possible to get the data from few organised stores and retail chains, the cost of labour involved in this data collection makes things much more challenging. On top comes the challenge in getting the field data in time without which the exercise would be futile.

                                <p>Often it becomes a challenge for sales organisations to manage sales order cancellation. The most common scenario is, after the sales person visits the retail counter and captures the sales order, the retail counter could either modify the sales order already registered or cancel the sales order in full. To cope with this scenario FieldMax® mobile users can now cancel the sales orders registered by them during the day through the mobile application. This is possible provided the backend team hasn`t processed the sales order through the FieldMax® office backend application. In such case the field user can retrieve the sales data in a separate field listed in the mobile application and make necessary modification and alterations.
